Task 1 - 
Learn about nmap, furthur investigaton required.



Task 2 - It was bought on http://www.ernet.in
  
  How did I find it-
  Used WHOIS to find about the website.  
  
  Resources - 
  http://whois.domaintools.com/iitmandi.ac.in - Gave information about IP, DNS, Domain Registrar etc.
  http://www.ernet.in/domain.html - Confirmed that ERNET India has been appointed as an exclusive domain registrar of domains like ac.in.

  https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html#hostname=https://students.iitmandi.ac.in/
  
  What I learned-
  1. WHOIS can be use to get information about websites.
  2. About Domain registars
  3. SSL Client Certificate to student.iitmandi.ac.in was given by GoDaddy.com, Inc.(and it expires in DEC-19 :P)
